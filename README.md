I am Rahim Lotfi
A computer science graduate and developer. With over seven years of experience as a developer, I have worked independently and with teams and gained a good knowledge of programming languages and the software development life cycle. I love writing well-organized and clean code. Colleagues usually praise my clean easily-understood lines of code. I enjoy refactoring code to make things more clear and easily maintainable. I am always open to feedback and never miss a chance to give ideas to improve the status quo. I love everything about learning new things and have no attachment to any framework, language, etc. To sum it up, an enthusiast learner, a neat coder, a helpful team-worker, and a stubborn problem solver with a great sense of humor & flexibility.
